Dear Alice,

I apologize for any inconvenience this issue may have caused you.

After further investigation, I discovered that when using the ping command to access site.recruitment.shq.nz, the IP address returned is 192.168.1.10, rather than the expected 223.165.64.38. Meanwhile, I found that 223.165.64.38 is indeed accessible, while 192.168.1.10 is not.

This discrepancy suggests that there may be an issue with the DNS resolution configuration. It's possible that the DNS records associated with site.recruitment.shq.nz are not correctly configured to point to the appropriate IP address.

Rest assured, our team will immediately begin troubleshooting this issue to identify and resolve any DNS configuration errors. Our goal is to ensure that your website is fully accessible as soon as possible.

Thank you for bringing this to our attention, and please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns.

Best regards,
SiteHost
